Final Push was the last change I made for the PyBank part of the homework and Final Push 1 was the last change I made for the PyPoll part of the challenge. 
Throughout both challenges I learned new ways of making the work easier, for example when printing, instead of writing out ("--------") I learned you can simply put the amount of lines you want such as ('-' * 30).
I also learned for how to f print. Both challenges have both ways of doing the printing as I didn't know what was more acceptable. 

In the main folder Python-Challenge you will find two folders: "Py Bank" & "PyPoll"
Inside each respective folder you will find "main.py", a Resource folder and an Analysis folder. 
All requirements of this challenge should be found in these folders.
